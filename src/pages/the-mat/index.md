## Sheila's Yoga Journey

Sheila initially picked up yoga as a cross training activity for other sports, and it evolved into a powerful tool for building inner strength, physical strength, and thoughtful self-study. Now, Sheila teaches yoga to empower others on their individual path, and to create a platform for an hour of unapologetic self-care and exploration. Her classes invite yogis to check in mentally, physically, and emotionally, and also to flex the muscles of mindfulness on and off the mat.

Sheila earned her 200 hour certification in yoga from [South Boston Yoga](https://www.southbostonyoga.net/) in Boston, Massachusetts.

### Past Teaching Spaces:

* [Pointe Barre Studios](https://www.pointebarrestudios.com/)
* [EVO Rock + Fitness](https://www.evorock.com/concord-nh/)

Sheila has also done a handful of one-off classes, including:

* Black Light Yoga
* Charity Yoga. [One class](https://www.threegoodthingsproject.com/yoga-event/) of which raised over $600 for [Comfort Zone Camp](https://comfortzonecamp.org/)
