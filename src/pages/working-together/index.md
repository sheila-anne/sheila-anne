faq:
  - question: How do I know if coaching is right for me?
    answer: >
      Life coaching is an effective way to progress your life into one that feels aligned, empowered, and fulfilling.  Coaching is designed to continually give power back to the client, to cultivate more growth and self-understanding. If you find yourself feeling like you might not be doing what you really want to do, in your career, physical space, relationships, activities, etc., life coaching can help you gain clarity in your future and take actions toward transformation. Different coaches will have different approaches and niches, so clients have options of the type of coach they want to work with. I specifically focus on health & wellness, life purpose, career coaching, and managing grief & change. To learn more about if we are a good fit, sign up for a complimentary 30 minute call.
  - question: How is coaching different from therapy?
    answer: >
      Therapy can be an amazing tool for working through past experiences, and with the right therapist you can create a beautiful space for healing and personal growth. On the other hand, life coaching is future-focused and progress oriented.  Sessions will focus on where you are and where you want to go. Though we may touch on the past to gain more perspective and context, we will always be bringing it back to the present and the future. I will also support you with accountability tools and homework, because I know that many of the successes and the ‚Äúa-ha‚Äùs actually occur outside of our time together.
  - question: Where are the coaching sessions held?
    answer: >
      Most clients and I meet via video conferencing.  I use a platform that allows us to meet in a private room and communicate in real time with clear video and sound.  I send a meeting link prior to our scheduled appointment.  Alternatively, we can meet via phone calls.
  - question: What can I expect to get out of coaching with Sheila Anne?
    answer: >
      Since life coaching is a client-driven experience, you are in the driver's seat. Put lots of effort into our sessions & into your life in between, and you will be rewarded exponentially! Each time we meet, you will come with something specific that you want to focus on (yes, it‚Äôs ok if the conversation organically takes a new direction if that‚Äôs what you want!) and it‚Äôs my job to support you with tools and additional perspectives. At the end we‚Äôll decide together what actions you will be accountable for before our next session, so you are always moving forward toward your goals. Each time we meet we will celebrate any accomplishments, and you also may always share personal frustrations and questions.

    text: In the 45 minutes I had with Sheila I managed to dig deep and discover how specific moments in the past may be contributing to some limiting beliefs that I hold. I felt very comfortable in the session which enabled me to open up and discover my deeply held beliefs that are holding me back!

    text: Working with Sheila was a wonderful experience. I sought her guidance regarding limiting beliefs surrounding a new career venture and in our short time together she was not only able to help me name and clearly identify those limiting beliefs, but also begin exploring alternate beliefs that are more supportive. She held space beautifully and her grounded, calm presence could be felt through the screen. By the end of the session I was feeling much more rooted and confident in myself and excited rather than scared shitless!

    text: Before my session with Sheila, I was a little nervous. I knew I had things I wanted to work on, but I wasn't sure if I would be able to find the right way to articulate them. But right away, Sheila helped ground me and provided a safe space by taking the time to work on breathwork and centering before we got started. I really enjoyed the questions she asked, and I felt that I was organically able to find answers without it feeling forced. She is also an incredible listener and was able to repeat back things I said verbatim and worked with me to unpack deeper meaning on them. After our session, I felt energized and excited and that feeling continued for the rest of the day. Thank you so much, Sheila!

<h2 id="root-to-rise">Root to Rise 3 Month Program</h2>
This 3 month, 1:1 coaching program is for those who are ready to create long-lasting change. Embark on a journey of dedicated self care, self discovery, and aligned action.

It‚Äôs so easy to make lists, check off action items, and let your busy brain lead the way. Oftentimes, though, we get stuck in being productive and perfecting each piece of ourselves that we forget to do the inner work - the work that makes the most profound impact on our lives.

‚ÄúRoot to rise‚Äù is a common verbal cue used in yoga. It signifies to first lay an intentional foundation then activate your muscles and grow tall while keeping structural integrity. Building a strong foundation = Limitless opportunity to grow strong and powerful.

- **Explore** all that makes you, you - Through journaling, visualizations, and assessments you‚Äôll gain deep self awareness and purpose.
- **Discover** your core values and make all future decisions from a place of intention - Let‚Äôs take the guessing out of decision making & create easy-flowing success.
- **Simplify** your life & infuse joy - We‚Äôll talk about mindful rituals, minimalism, prioritization, and celebrating things that matter. Simplicity is a core principle of my coaching because I believe your life can be simple and full!
- **Cultivate** a mind-body connection that will help you prioritize your well being and make lasting change . Set aside your expectations for needing how-to guides and expensive wellness trends, we‚Äôre taking things a little deeper here! Here you‚Äôll face your inner monologue and self-sabotaging stories. We‚Äôll talk about how to develop a fresh mindset that is more aligned with the confidence and fulfillment you hope to create.
- **Create** an inspiring future - Once you‚Äôve built the foundation, developed clarity around your future, and connected to your whole self - your potential is limitless. You establish goals and action steps to get you there and have me as your accountability partner & cheerleader as you root and rise.

Invest in yourself! There is truly no better time than now.
