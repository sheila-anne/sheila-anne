## Notes from my writing desk.

Each individual has a way of expressing their deep thoughts, dreams, and passions. My medium is writing. When I was a kid, I wrote poetry, short stories, and persuasive pieces. I found blogging when I was in college and felt naturally aligned with the informal, authentic nature of the original blogging platforms. I write to share my stories, to tap into universal emotion, and offer perspective and tidbits of information for my readers.

My work:

- [She & Jim](https://www.sheandjim.com/) -- my adventure travel blog
- [Thorn Alexander -- There She Goes](https://thornalexanderstyle.com/there-she-goes) -- curated weekly uplifting news for this inspirational contemporary needlepoint brand

I hope you'll enjoy the content I create here and elsewhere.
