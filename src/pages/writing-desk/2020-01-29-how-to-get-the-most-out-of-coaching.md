Coaching is a partnership between the client (you!) and the coach (me!).  The more that you put into your sessions, the more you’ll get out of them.  Remember, the 1:1 sessions are a dedicated block of time for us to focus in on you, helping you to: 

* embrace your inner power 
* release limiting beliefs
* transform your life!

With all that in mind, I want to help you maximize our time together.  Sharing a few tips & tricks below!

**Make sure you have a good connection**

Sessions are held via video conferencing or over the phone. Please ensure that you have a good internet connection or cell service so that we can clearly hear one another.

**Put yourself in a space where you won’t be distracted**

Though things going on around you (pets barking, people talking, music playing) may not seem like a big deal at first, they may not allow you to be fully present for yourself. To maximize the outcome and quality of each session, try to put yourself in a space that is quiet and comfortable, and where you won’t be interrupted.

**Get comfortable**

A typical session will be about 50-60 minutes long. Before we begin, set yourself up with water, writing materials (if desired), and perhaps cozy things like a blanket or pillow. This way, you can feel all settled when we begin!

**Nourish your brain / body**

Coaching sessions will be most impactful when you are fully present, in mind and body. Help yourself to get there with nourishing things that ground you. Try to drink lots of fluids like water and warm tea around and during our sessions. If exercise helps, try to schedule that in before our sessions. Eat whole foods and carve out time for good sleep. If meditation or journaling have proven to be helpful, make time for those things. There is no one-size-fits-all approach and I will never prescribe something for you; only share ideas. I always encourage people to be really gentle with themselves through this journey! Be open to change, to emotional waves, and to positive transformation. It’s a truly remarkable ride. See “Self Care for the Hectic Life” for more ideas.

**Come to the session with something to focus on**

The more you put into coaching, the more you’ll get out of it! To get the most out of coaching, be prepared to fully participate in our partnership. Each session, come with one thing or a few things that you would like to focus on. Sometimes we may end up in a totally different spot discovering something new, but it will be your work and preparation that helps get us there! Don’t hesitate to express deep dreams, doubts, and ideas. I will support you to embrace your power, release beliefs that don’t serve you, and to discover great insights about yourself and the world.

**Be open!**

The more honest and open you are, with both yourself and your coach, the more we’ll learn together. Be prepared to share your story, your desires, and any obstacles. This will allow us the greatest insight, to explore all opportunities, and to set you up for success! If there is a topic that for you is “off limits,” we can name that and leave it out of our sessions.
