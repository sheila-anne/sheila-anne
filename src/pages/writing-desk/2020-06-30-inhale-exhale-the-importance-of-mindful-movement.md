Inhale exhale inhale exhale

I can’t believe the road rage of that driver this morning

Inhale exhale inhale exhale

Ug. I should have worn my other pants, these ones aren’t as comfy

Inhale exhale inhale exhale

Wow my shoulders feel tight today

Inhale exhale inhale exhale

Oooh I love cat cows, yes!

Inhale exhale inhale exhale

This song is groovy, I love flowing to the beat

Inhale exhale inhale exhale

Letting goooo of what doesn’t serve me, welcoming in the good energy

Inhale exhale inhale exhale

Feelin’ strong, feelin’ calm

This is why I love yoga. Movement, music, & meditation gently tug my awareness from my busy brain to my intuitive body. When I step onto the rubber of my mat, I step into a place of peace and inner power.

Everyone has their own way of releasing stress and fueling motivation and I find my way through mindful movement. Yoga is not the only way, though. I run, I climb, I strength-train, I love a leisurely stroll with a friend, and I enjoy needlepointing.

My idea of movement and fitness used to be much more strict. For most of my life and particularly when I was 18-23, I relied on my body to charge forward and perform when I said so. For a while, feeling the burn and getting my sweat on was the only way to manage stress and feel just *generally* good.

That was risky business - should the capacity to move dwindle… so would I. This is what happened when I dislocated my peroneal tendon in March of 2017.

## My breakup with a rigid fitness routine

One morning before work I went to an indoor climbing gym with a friend. We were warming up on some easy bouldering routes and it was my turn to climb. Halfway up the wall I pulled up my foot to the next hold and pushed down on the hold with my toes, and POP. Confused but not in much pain, I climbed down and realized that the tendon that once sat snug against the back of my ankle bone had shifted forward and was loose… yikes.

After surgery, my new normal became crutching an extra 3 pounds of weight on my left leg during the day and “sleeping” on my back with my foot elevated by two pillows at night. I struggled to feel rested, mindful, and happy during this time.

The weight on my leg seemed to also weigh on my heart.

During this time I gained empathy for those unable to move their bodies in the way that they want to. I knew that my situation was temporary and, still, that wasn’t always enough to keep me sane & positive. My active commute, fitness routine, and sense of independence had radically changed and, due to that, I struggled with my sense of self.

I decided that it was time to break my dependence with exercise as a survival *necessity* and dig deeper into the intention behind my movement.

## Mindfulness and movement

Intentional movement is a way to drop into mindfulness and decrease stress. That’s probably not new for anyone to hear. What is interesting, and perhaps novel, is that simply moving is not enough — If you go on a run and stress about your upcoming presentation, you may be doing yourself a disservice. Research has shown that linking mindfulness to movement — bringing awareness to your surroundings and your purpose —[can improve self-management and overall well being](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/06/21/marrying-mindfulness-with-movement-reduces-stress-boosts-mood/#1d2100b7262a)❤.

As I reflect on a handful of vivid memories walking off a stressful day in Boston, running the hills of New Hampshire during an epic Reach The Beach challenge, and sipping lattes as I caught up with friends, I realize that it wasn’t necessarily *movement* that guided me into a state of meditation and experience, but rather my sensory awareness and capacity to be present.

As it turned out, my experience recovering from an injury became my opportunity to reconnect to myself and the abundance of mediums available to find peace & power. I started focusing more on my mind-body connection and I allowed myself more flexibility when it came to deciding on how I would move my body and mind; one day it could be a hard strength training session, the next a slow flow on my yoga mat, the next a stitching session with my latest needlepoint canvas.

## Reflection

Questioning the link between my fitness performance and my sense of self is still an active practice. For so long, I was reliant on hard exercise to bring my peace of mind as well as confidence. I realize now that, while movement is important, mindfulness and having other outlets is key. When I am not moving my body, I’ve learned to move my mind through things like needlepoint, writing, and taking part in deep conversations. These are a beautiful supplement to my movement-filled life, as they encourage me to slow down and become more intentional about how I move through the world.

Questions to reflect on:

Am I reliant on my fitness regimen to reduce stress?

When do I feel most mindful?

How can I incorporate more mindfulness into my movement? Into my life?

Keep in mind that this is a continuous unraveling of discovery. If you’re feeling curious about how to be more mindful, I invite you to try [Yoga for an Open Heart](https://www.sheilaanne.com/writing-desk/2020-01-29-yoga-for-an-open-heart/) and let the answers flow to you.
