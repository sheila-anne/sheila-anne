When you hear the term “life coach” what comes to mind?

Is it…

* A personal trainer-type who is assisting with workouts, self-care, and nutrition?
* A woman in an office-setting, coaching an entrepreneur on their latest business venture? 
* Two people meeting virtually, across the country from one another, discussing the meaning of life, success, fulfillment, and courage.
* An entrepreneur with online courses, helping new college grads find their career path?

Something else?

The reality is that “life coaching” can be all of those things… and more! 

The label “life coach” can be a bit abstract, so I’m breaking it down for you here. We’ll explore the basics of what a life coach is, and how it may differ from the other people-helping services. Perhaps this will simply increase your awareness, or perhaps it will help you make the decision on the kind of resource you need in your life right now.

Either way, I’m happy you’re here - let’s jump in!

## What is Life Coaching?

While life coaching emerged from the business world, as executive coaching, with a quick search online, you will find coaches that solve just about any problem under the sun! As a whole, life coaches can help you to clarify your goals, uncover obstacles, and strategize a path toward success. Each coach will do so in their own unique way, though a collaborative process.

There are a multitude of coaching programs out there that provide aspiring coaches with a strong foundation to serve their clients. Some of the coaching schools out there are accredited by the [International Coaching Federation (ICF)](https://coachfederation.org/) which offers the only globally-recognized, independent credentialing program for coach practitioners. I earned my coach training through [Coach Training World](https://coachtrainingworld.com/), which is accredited by the ICF. This allowed me to go on and become an ICF Associate Certified Coach.

## **Life Coaching Versus Talk Therapy**

Both life coaches and therapists have a mission of helping individuals to reach their highest potential. Though there is certainly overlap between why a person may seek a therapist or a coach, it is key to understand the differences for the wellbeing and results of the seeker.

* Talk therapy can be delivered by psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, or licensed counselors. 
* Coaching can be delivered by anyone who decides to step into the role of a coach.
* A therapist is able to help you with mental mental health difficulties, diagnosis and assessment.
* A coach is able to help you explore dreams and meet benchmarks that will lead to more success and fulfillment.
* Therapy is regulated -  therapists are bound by a code of ethics and state and federal law. They also need to be licensed in their state.
* Coaching is unregulated, which is why it’s helpful to take extra care in researching a coach’s background, to see if they have formal training (and the associated accreditation) if that is important to you.

## **Life Coaching Versus Mentoring**

Life coaching and mentorship both focus on cultivating a special relationship that is meant to lift up and resource the coachee/mentee.  However, there are some distinct differences.

* Think of mentors as pathwalkers who say: “Here let me show you the way!” They have likely been in the mentee shoes before, and their aim is to help their mentee by resourcing them with skills and experience.
* Coaches would, in this case, ask the coachee: “Which way?” and support them in the path they choose and any blind spot they may be missing.
* The mentor/mentee may work for the same organisation
* A coach and coachee may work on separate continents.
* Mentors typically do not have formal training nor a specific process with which they help their mentee.
* Coaches typically have special training in how to best guide a coachee

## **Life Coaching Versus Consulting** 

Knowing when to employ coaching and when to employ consulting can be critical for the success of the coachee/client. Yet the line between consulting and coaching can sometimes be a little blurry. Here are some key distinctions:

* Think of consultants as navigators on a ship, saying “Here’s where to go!” to the captain
* In this case, the coach would be beside the captain, guiding them through the process until they felt comfortable to steer on their own.
* Consultants support their clients with specific recommendations and direct their action.
* Coaches will help coachee’s explore possibilities and decisions for themselves
* Consulting focuses on a solving a specific challenge
* Coaching focuses on building the capacity and interwoven pieces of a coachee’s life.
