title: Morning Ritual In A Cup

description: What if what you think of as a “habit” or “routine” could also be
  your ritual, or sequential activity that you do on a daily basis while being
  completely present.  Establishing a morning ritual is an effective way to
  increase motivation, productivity, and mindfulness throughout the day.  As I’m
  a lover of the morning, I have a few rituals, and today it’s all about coffee.

*Feat. Coconut oil, cinnamon, nutmeg*

Coffee making is one of my favorite morning rituals, as there are so many sensory things happening - the buzzing of the tea pot, the smell of the beans, the feel of the steam, ect. That said, the same thing could be replicated for almost any activity.
