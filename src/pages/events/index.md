## Free: Unlock your power by befriending your nervous system

_Wednesday, June 1st_

_5 PM - 6:15 PM MT_

Are you ready to connect more authentically with yourself and show up better for your career and relationships? It’s time to find **freedom** from within by understanding and befriending your nervous system!

Our autonomic nervous system is what shapes our being, our relationships, and our actions. And a dysregulated nervous system makes us play small. Join Sheila Anne for a workshop dedicated to understanding your nervous system to find freedom and self connection.

What will be covered:

- Training on the 3 key nervous system states
- How being in these states influences your life, career, relationships
- Identification on what state is most dominant for you

This 75 minute event will include mindfulness practice, training, and individualized support.
