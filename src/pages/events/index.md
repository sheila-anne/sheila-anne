## Celebrate & Retreat

- BOSTON - DECEMBER 11, 2021
- 1-4 PM EST

We might not be able to head to Costa Rica this year, but we are going to retreat on a beautiful afternoon together in Boston! This event will be held on the first quarter moon (a significant time for bringing visions into reality). The event will be held at a super special studio, [The Yoga Playground](https://www.yogaplayground.org/).

### What can you expect?

- a three hour in-person mini retreat full to the brim of heart opening, vibration lifting, feel-good experiences
- a chance to move and play through a yoga flow
- reflection through journaling, defined affirmation statements and power poses to channel your inner bad ass
- grounding and healing with a guided visualization with me and reiki by the amazing Krysta Lyn
- connecting and celebrating with an unforgettable **cacao** ceremony
- a couple other surprises trickled in
