## Flow & Envision

Sunday December 15th 12PM - 2PM | [3 Bridges Yoga](https://www.3bridgesyoga.com/)

Engage in a powerful vinyasa flow to center your mind and nourish your body, then channel that energy into creating a vision board that reflects your ambitions. Come ready to sweat, dream big, and leave with a tangible vision for your unique path.
