Kickstart 2023 with badass females who are creating an intentional, fulfilling, delicious year without getting burned like toast üî•. Escape the nonsense of capitalist New Years Resolutions asking you to go-go-go, and instead build toward a kick-ass year that will feel good in body, mind, and soul.
