# Self Workshop Series

Are you craving a little more community, confidence, and courage?

You will not want to miss this summer workshop series happening once a month May - July. Each workshop will be ~75 minutes and will include training, a guided visualization, and reiki! Connect with your heart-space, raise your energetic vibration, ignite your inner spark. Prepare to connect with others on the topic of self-love and prioritizing YOU.

There will be three separate events, **Self-Love**, **Self-Worth** and **Self-Trust**.  Attend one or all! They will build upon each other in a beautiful way, and each will be beneficial and magical as a stand-alone if you cannot attend them all. Limited number of spots available, as this will be an intimate event. Led by [Sheila Anne](/) & [Krysta-Lyn](https://www.krysta-lyn.com/).

If you would like to attend all three events, make sure to purchase the bundle to save!
