## Notes from my writing desk.

I write for my dear friend Brooke's contemporary needlepoint company, [Thorn Alexander](https://thornalexanderstyle.com/there-she-goes), as well as on the adventural travel blog, [She & Jim](https://www.sheandjim.com/). In addition to that, I blog about health, wellness, and how to achieve the right balance between living your best life and being centered right here.

I hope you'll enjoy the content I create here and elsewhere.
