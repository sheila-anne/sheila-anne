# My Story

When I was young I wandered barefoot. I loved the feel of the changing earth under my feet — grass, to sand, to pavement, to rock, the occasional barefoot steps on frozen ground. I whiled away hours in the woods, lost in daydreams.

Like many, I experienced stress & anxiety as I grew into my own, and I set expectations for myself that were lofty and only briefly celebrated when met. Those that know me would probably remark about my “zest for life.” I have always seen life as an adventure, and am energized by new people and situations. In the past, I struggled to balance this excitement for experiencing the world and my deeply-seeded perfectionist mentality. My thought process was likely something like: “Why waste time not being the absolute best you can be?” I worked tirelessly through various careers, I earned success, but… I still felt unfulfilled. I had a thriving friend group, a never-ending list of activities, a powerhouse work ethic, and a tight-knit family. I didn’t see anything wrong — do you?

In 2017, at the height of my summer travels, reality rapidly changed — my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Inertia and habit wanted me to continue on, head up, smiling. My heart wanted me to pay attention; to open up; to accept help.

I began to slow down, to realign with my core self, and to redesign my path forward.

My mom passed in the late summer of 2018 and I started taking courageous action toward my dreams - leading life my way. I earned my 200hr Yoga Teacher Training, left the working world to backpack Europe with my partner, began training to become a life coach, and moved to Denver, Colorado.

I came home to myself, trusted my intuition, and committed to aligned action. This helped me find my footing and explore the world with the curiosity and joy that I once did.

[Now I coach others to do the same](/working-together/). I specialize in helping high-achieving women to realign with who they are, redesign their path forward, and transform their careers, relationships, and lifestyles. We use a blend of coaching tools, mindfulness techniques, and accountability check-ins to get you the feel-good results you’re craving.
