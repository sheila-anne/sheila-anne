## Sheila Anne: The Short Story

Sheila is a yogi, writer, travel enthusiast, and life coach originally from New Hampshire. Sheila’s middle name, “Anne,” has been passed down through the generations and has been recently reclaimed as a nod to Sheila’s mother, Ann-Marie, who passed in 2018. Sheila lived in Boston, Massachusetts for four years; first working in sales, then project management, and eventually in management in the fitness industry. She earned her 200 hour yoga teacher training certificate at South Boston Yoga in early 2019 and has been teaching yoga ever since. Sheila left her life in Boston to pursue a great adventure across Europe with her fiance, and together they started a blog called She & Jim.

The common thread through career pivots, location changes, loss, and successes, has been Sheila’s love for and great ability to help others find their inner compass and navigate their own way. Sheila started Sheila Anne at the end of 2019, just before making big moves to Colorado! If the idea of building confidence, making positive changes, and stepping into your power excites you, you’re in the right spot!
