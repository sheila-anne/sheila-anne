# Hi, I'm Sheila

My mission is to help ambitious women to confidently step into their next-level selves and thrive in their bodies, minds, and souls.

I work with goal-getters that are always striving toward the next thing and hardly have a moment to breathe and connect with themselves. Sound familiar? This used to be me - I thought I had it all figured out because I was killin’ it at work, I had a never-ending list of activities, and people looked to me as a confident leader. The problem? I was burning out, indecisive about my future, and was more attached to appearing successful than I was to my wellbeing & following my dreams.

When I lost my mom -my light- to cancer in 2018 I began to slow down, to realign with my core self, and to redesign my path forward. This led me to earn my 200hr Yoga Teacher Training certification, leave the working world to backpack Europe with my partner, pivot toward the path of life coaching, and move across the country to Denver, Colorado.

Now I coach others to come home to themselves and transform their lives. I’ve worked with women to overcome perfectionism, to take a leap into their next business venture, to realign with their core purpose, and to feel more confident in every aspect of their lives. I use a unique blend of mindfulness, strategic goal setting, and proven coaching techniques to get them the results they desire. I believe coaching is a co-creative process -- I hold the supportive and progress-driven container and you step into the driver’s seat of where our journey takes us and how quickly it moves.

My superpower is my ability to help you slow down, connect with your body, and achieve from a place of alignment and powerful confidence. The integration of mindfulness and meditation is what helps you step off the hamster wheel, reflect on what you truly desire, and rise into the most badass version of you.

### Trauma-Informed Certified Coach

As a trauma-informed coach, I am trained in research-backed approaches to help my clients become resourced and resilient. We may discuss polyvagal theory, window of tolerance, the impact of stress on the body, self regulation, and more. In my practice, I use the definition laid out by the American Psychological Association (APA), which says that trauma can be an event or series of events that has lasting adverse effects on physically, socially, emotionally, spiritually, and on the well-being of the individual. I draw a firm boundary between coaching and therapy and help clients to find the most suitable provider for their needs.
