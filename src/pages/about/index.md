# My Story

When I was young I wandered barefoot. I loved the feel of the changing earth under my feet -- grass, to sand, to pavement, to rock, the occasional barefoot steps on frozen ground. I whiled away hours in the woods, lost in daydreams.

As I grew up my mind became a busier & more productive place.

Like many, I experienced social anxiety as I grew into my own, and I set expectations for myself that were lofty and only briefly celebrated when met. Though I was nurtured in a happy, New Hampshire family that was loving and supportive I, like my mom, was an eternal optimist and secret worry-wart. My stress levels would rise and fall as quickly as the wind. _Sound familiar?_

Those that know me would probably remark about my “zest for life.” I have always seen life as an adventure, and am energized by new people and situations. In the past, I struggled to balance this excitement for experiencing the world and my deeply-seeded perfectionist mentality. My thought process was likely something like: "Why waste time not being the absolute best you can be?" I worked tirelessly through various careers, I earned success, but… I still felt unfulfilled. I had a thriving friend group, a never-ending list of activities, a powerhouse work ethic, and a tight-knit family. I didn’t see anything wrong -- _do you_?

In 2017, at the height of my summer travels, reality rapidly changed -- my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Inertia and habit wanted me to continue on, head up, smiling. My heart wanted me to pay attention; to open up; to accept help. I realized that, though I was a free-spirited extrovert, I had bolted-up my heart space, and allowed my achiever mentality to guide every step.

I began to slow down, to undo some of those bolts, and found ways to cultivate inner peace alongside my achiever-self. At this time I also welcomed a relationship into my life, making an intentional choice to put my arm down, to open the door to deeper connection. In turn, I had opened the door to a deeper connection with myself.

My mom passed in the late summer of 2018 and the rest of the year was filled with changes - I worked in the fitness industry for a few months, earned my 200hr Yoga Teacher Training, and then left the working world to backpack Europe with my partner. We [started an adventure blog](https://www.sheandjim.com/) where we reflected on our experiences traveling and learning about ourselves and one another. Traveling helped me to “come home” to myself once again, as I found my footing and explored the world with the curiosity of a child.

[Now I coach others to do the same](/working-together/). I help women to connect to themselves, cultivate inner peace, and follow their deep purpose so that they don’t worry about a life unlived. I have been privileged to watch my clients explore their unique strengths, to experience transformation, and to “come home” to themselves, just as I did.
