# My Story

When I was young I wandered barefoot. I loved the feel of the changing earth under my feet - grass, to sand, to pavement, to rock, the occasional barefoot steps on frozen ground. I whiled away hours in the woods, lost in daydreams.

As I grew up my mind became a busier & more *productive* place.

Like many, I experienced social anxiety as I grew into my own, and I set expectations for myself that were lofty and only briefly celebrated when met. Though I was nurtured in a happy, New Hampshire family that was loving and supportive I, like my mom, was an eternal optimist and secret worry-wart. My stress levels would rise and fall as quickly as the wind.

In high school I had a near-fatal illness and through this experience I gained a deeper sense of self and a new appreciation for life. Equally so, I became even more of a perfectionist. My thought process was likely something like, *Why waste time not being the absolute best you can be?*

After college I had a brief reminder of who I was while living on the coast for four months: I swam in the ocean; washed in an outdoor shower; and walked barefoot. It was like coming home, between the earth & sun. It didn’t last long, though, as my achiever mentality took hold and I moved to Boston. I started in an entry-level sales position and was quickly promoted ... because, well, I was exactly what you’d want in a sales person - inexhaustible, extroverted, strategic, and driven by goals and metrics. I worked tirelessly and became the most successful person on my floor but… I still felt unfulfilled.

Soon I was waking up at 5am to get to the gym (calling my mom along the way as, she too, was an early riser); I would work from 8 - 6 and occasionally take a lunch or do mid-day run; then would busy myself right up until it was time to sleep at ... which point I would basically fall into my bed. I had a thriving friend group, a never-ending list of activities, a powerhouse work ethic, and a tight-knit family. I didn’t see anything wrong - do you?

In 2017, at the height of my summer travels, reality rapidly changed - my mom was diagnosed with cancer. Seeing someone so strong fall to illness was a wakeup call. Inertia and habit wanted me to continue on, head up, smiling. My heart wanted me to pay attention; to open up; to accept help.  I realized that, though I was a free-spirited extrovert, I had bolted-up my heart space, and allowed my achiever mentality to guide every step.  

I began to slow down, to undo some of those bolts, and found ways to cultivate inner peace alongside my achiever-self.  At this time I also welcomed a relationship into my life, making an intentional choice to put my arm down, to open the door to deeper connection.  In turn, I had opened the door to a deeper connection with myself.

My mom passed in the late summer of 2018 and the rest of the year was filled with changes - I worked in the fitness industry for a few months, earned my 200hr Yoga Teacher Training, and then left the working world to backpack Europe with my partner.   We [started an adventure blog](https://www.sheandjim.com/) where we reflected on our experiences traveling and learning about ourselves and one another.  Traveling helped my to "come home" to myself once again, as I found my footing and explored the world with the curiousity of a child.  

Now I coach othes to do the same.  I help women to connect to themselves, cultivate inner peace, and follow their deep purpose so that they don't worry about a life unlived.  I have been privileged to watch my clients explore their unique strengths, to experience transformation, and to "come home" to themselves, just I did.
