# Pura Vida Retreat

![Pura Vida retreat hero image](./img/hero-image-costa-rica-retreat.png)

In Tamarindo, Costa Rica

February 5 - 10 & February 12 - 17, 2024

Join us for an immersive experience in nature where we will vinyasa to the sounds of bird and monkeys, create new friendships and perspectives, and be healed and rejuvenated by sun, sand, and movement. It’s time to unplug, lean into community, and treat yourself to an unforgettable experience.

## What past retreaters are saying…

> "I came for the yoga and stayed for the incredible community, delicious food, and furry friends at El Sabanero! Thanks Krysta-Lyn and Sheila - your leadership, unmatched shared energy, and complementary strengths that made for a fun, challenging, and energizing week of yoga, adventures, and new friends. I can’t wait for next year!"

We can’t wait to go back to Costa Rica and this time we are thrilled to offer **TWO** retreat week options!

_Disclosure: This is a Pura Vida Lifestyle Retreat and not a luxury accommodation retreat. There are bugs, bats, and creatures around. The beds are not luxe & plush but the cabinas are part of the cultural experience. This is an opportunity to fully immerse yourself into the pura vida mindset and lifestyle and we totally understand if that lifestyle doesn’t suit you._

## More Love From Past Retreaters

> “El Sabanero is heaven on earth. The perfect place to unwind and reset. Krysta and Sheila were great as well as other guest instructors that taught. Overall great experience!”

> “This trip is life changing if you allow it to be. If you are looking for a space to reflect, heal, and truly listen to yourself away from the daily grind, this is the retreat for you. It is well organized and there are no pressures to follow any schedule. It is led by two informative and positive ladies who will share their knowledge with you and support you wherever you are in your journey!”

> “This retreat was more than I could’ve hoped for. I was given the option to participate in as little or as much as I want and encouraged to really listen to my needs. Sheila and Krysta-Lyn were warm, friendly hosts and really did a great job keeping us organized. There was a variety of yoga practices, delicious food, and such an amazing community built while we were there. I’d do it again in a heartbeat.”

> “A wonderful group, a wonderful location, what more can be asked for.”

> “DO IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I signed up for this retreat as a gift to myself to recenter myself and remind myself of what brings me joy. I was super nervous going into this retreat because I didn’t know anybody past our pre-retreat zoom, but I left with a whole new community, one that I can rely on and that made me feel pure joy for an entire week. I am in no way a professional or expert at Yoga, and you don’t need to be to attend this retreat! It is for anybody and everybody! You will feel safe, and you feel seen and heard. You will leave feeling all the emotions, but most importantly, you’ll leave feeling more confident in yourself and your yoga practice!”
