## The Epic Experience

In Tamarindo, Costa Rica

- SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2025 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2025

A one-of-a-kind pura vida retreat! You can expect 2025 to offer the same soul-fueling fun but enhancements to keep it fresh!

Join us for an immersive experience in nature where we will vinyasa to the sounds of birds and monkeys, create new friendships and perspectives, and be healed and rejuvenated by sun, sand, and movement. It's time to unplug, lean into community, and treat yourself to an unforgettable experience.

We've added an extra day & night as well as a cultural experience, sunset meditation, sunrise hike & more! Week 1 is reserved exclusively for women-identifying folks. Week 2 will be open for all genders. [You can join the waitlist here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn1COIzH77mhA6a1zlikUICvrFu-tMJHPBVSbU72HfwnJiwA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## What past retreaters are saying...

> "When I booked my spot for the Costa Rica Pura Vida Retreat, I was looking for a reset and a way to get away from the city and come home feeling healthy, refreshed & restored! This retreat did all that AND MUCH MORE. I instantly felt a sense of community and connection to the other participants and left with new friends and a love for a country (and its people) that I had never visited before! Couldn't recommend enough - I will also say that the quality and instruction of yoga is top tier!!"

_Disclosure: this is a Pura Vida Lifestyle Retreat and we are staying in the jungle in Costa Rica - there are bugs, creatures, & the beds aren't luxe & plush, but the cabinas are part of the cultural experience. This is a full immersion into the lifestyle. If that lifestyle doesn't suit you, we get it and want to be fully transparent!_

## More Love From Past Retreaters

> "Transformative. Magical. Extraordinary. These are just a few of the words that come to mind when I think of the truly one-of-a-kind week I spent with Sheila, Krysta-Lyn and all my new friends at the Pura Vida Retreat. Whether you're looking for a yoga retreat to deepen your practice, a place to heal and grow, an opportunity to make new connections and relationships, or soak up the sunshine - this retreat is for you. You'll do all of that and BEYOND. You'll discover new parts of yourself, you'll experience the people, food and Pura Vida lifestyle of Costa Rica and you'll be enchanted by the coastline and sunrises/sunsets. It was such a life-changing experience for myself and many others - I can't wait to join this retreat again in 2025!!!!"

> "I was a return retreater and the experience felt just as magical! The trip is flexible so that you are able to make it exactly what you need/want it to be."

> "Don't hesitate, just do it! Do it for yourself; Trust me, you won't regret it. I've gone on the Pura Vida retreat twice now and have loved every second of both years. Not only do I get to check in with myself and fill my cup, but I also get to connect with amazing people and build my community. The best way to explain it was my first year at the retreat helped me figure out where I want to be and what path(s) I need to begin to get there, and year 2 allowed me to stop from the craziness and check in with myself; make sure I was still on the path I wanted and was doing the right things for myself and my journey. Can't forget the amazing leaders Sheila and Krysta-Lyn! They have created an amazing, fun, warming and welcoming safe space for us to all enjoy and be comfortable with getting vulnerable together."

> "This retreat was incredible. I got more than I could have possibly imagined from it - physically, mentally, spiritually. Just go it's the best way to pause, reset & focus."

## El Sabanero Eco-Lodge & Costa Rica

El Sabanero Eco-Lodge is located within the Nicoya Peninsula, a Blue Zone! A Blue Zone is a place where the number of people that live to 100 is up to 10 times higher than the rest of the world. Other Blue Zones include places like Okinawa, Japan and Ikaria, Greece. El Sabanero is a 10 min drive to Tamarindo Beach Resort and only 15 min from world-class surf spots such as Avellanas Beach, Playa Negra and Playa Grande.

Krysta-Lyn arrived to El Sabanero in 2019 as a student and returned in 2020 as a yoga instructor being able to live and breathe its magic for an entire month. El Sabanero is a family, a safe space and a home for yogis around the world. It's a true honor to share this special place with our community members.

This will be our third time hosting a retreat at El Sabanero and over the past couple of years it's become home. We ask you to treat the staff, animals, and property with respect, and that it becomes a home for you too.

## Meet Your Guides For The Week

![Sheila & Krysta-Lyn during the retreat](/img/sheila-and-krysta-lyn.jpg)

**Krysta-Lyn** of [Radiate Wellness](https://www.radiatewellness.co/)

Krysta-Lyn found refuge in the combination of yoga, counseling and community after the loss of her mother in 2013. Overcome by the immense sense of peace yoga could provide, she immersed herself in her practice learning that life truly exists between the inhale and exhale. Krysta-Lyn sought to share her passion and received her 200 hour yoga teacher certification from South Boston Yoga in 2018. In 2019 she left the world of finance to seek a healthy, balanced career and life of healing. She earned a Reiki Masters Certification and a Masters of Science in Mental Health Counseling in May 2022. Her dearest friends call her their sunshine and she hopes to help others find what makes them **radiate**!

**Sheila Anne** of Sheila Anne Coaching + Wellness

Sheila visited Costa Rica for the first time in 2014 (where she also connected with long lost family!) and each time she returns feels like a special homecoming. Her favorite part of the annual retreat is getting to know individuals on a deeper level and experiencing transformational practices together like those from guest yoga teachers and time spent out in nature! Sheila received her 200 hour yoga teacher certification with Krysta-Lyn at South Boston Yoga. She actually missed the first certification weekend for her mother's funeral service, so the training came at a potent time of healing and self evolution. She and Krysta-Lyn were meant to connect and collaborate due to their shared pasts and future goals! Sheila became an ICF Professional Certified Coach and works with individuals, groups, and businesses. In the last few years, she has added Buti Yoga and Reiki energy healing into her repertoire. She believes that when we come home to ourselves we transform our lives.

## Land Acknowledgement

Per the Smithsonian:

> "Land acknowledgment is a traditional custom that dates back centuries in many Native nations and communities. Today, land acknowledgments are used by Native Peoples and non-Natives to recognize Indigenous Peoples who are the original stewards of the lands on which we now live."

This retreat takes place in the Guanacaste province of Costa Rica, the unceded territory called Matambú of the Chorotega people. Chorotega translates to "The Fleeing People," representing the history of Chorotegas fleeing Mexico for Costa Rica in AD 500 to escape slavery.
