Join us for an immersive experience in nature where we will vinyasa to the sounds of bird and monkeys, create new friendships and perspectives, and be healed and rejuvenated by sun, sand, and movement. It’s time to unplug, lean into community, and treat yourself to an unforgettable experience.

## Meet Your Guides For The Week

**Krysta-Lyn** of [Radiate Wellness](https://www.radiatewellness.co/)

Krysta-Lyn found refuge in the combination of yoga, counseling and community after the loss of her mother in 2013. Overcome by the immense sense of peace yoga could provide, she immersed herself in her practice learning that life truly exists between the inhale and exhale. Krysta-Lyn sought to share her passion and received her 200 hour yoga teacher certification from South Boston Yoga in 2018. In 2019 she left the world of finance to seek a healthy, balanced career and life of healing. She earned a Reiki Masters Certification and a Masters of Science in Mental Health Counseling in May 2022. Her dearest friends call her their sunshine and she hopes to help others find what makes them **radiate**!

**Sheila Anne** of Sheila Anne Coaching + Wellness

Sheila visited Costa Rica for the first time in 2014 (where she also connected with long lost family!) and each time she returns feels like a special homecoming. Her favorite part of the Pura Vida 2023 retreat was getting to know individuals on a deeper level and experiencing transformational practices together like those from guest yoga teachers and time spent out in nature! Sheila received her 200 hour yoga teacher certification with Krysta-Lyn at South Boston Yoga. She actually missed the first certification weekend for her mother’s funeral service, so the training came at a potent time of healing and self evolution. She and Krysta-Lyn were meant to connect and collaborate due to their shared pasts and future goals! Sheila became an ICF Professional Certified Coach and works with individuals, groups, and businesses. In the last year she added Buti Yoga and Reiki energy healing into her repertoire. She believes that when we come home to ourselves we transform our lives.

## More Love From Past Retreaters

> “El Sabanero is heaven on earth. The perfect place to unwind and reset. Krysta and Sheila were great as well as other guest instructors that taught. Overall great experience!”

> “This trip is life changing if you allow it to be. If you are looking for a space to reflect, heal, and truly listen to yourself away from the daily grind, this is the retreat for you. It is well organized and there are no pressures to follow any schedule. It is led by two informative and positive ladies who will share their knowledge with you and support you wherever you are in your journey!”

> “This retreat was more than I could’ve hoped for. I was given the option to participate in as little or as much as I want and encouraged to really listen to my needs. Sheila and Krysta-Lyn were warm, friendly hosts and really did a great job keeping us organized. There was a variety of yoga practices, delicious food, and such an amazing community built while we were there. I’d do it again in a heartbeat.”

> “A wonderful group, a wonderful location, what more can be asked for.”

> “DO IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I signed up for this retreat as a gift to myself to recenter myself and remind myself of what brings me joy. I was super nervous going into this retreat because I didn’t know anybody past our pre-retreat zoom, but I left with a whole new community, one that I can rely on and that made me feel pure joy for an entire week. I am in no way a professional or expert at Yoga, and you don’t need to be to attend this retreat! It is for anybody and everybody! You will feel safe, and you feel seen and heard. You will leave feeling all the emotions, but most importantly, you’ll leave feeling more confident in yourself and your yoga practice!”

> "The week spent in Costa Rica was a dream. My goal was to truly disconnect from work and everything overwhelming me and to have the opportunity to slow down and find what brings me peace, and that’s exactly what happened. We had the most incredible group of people, led by two amazing women. Krysta-Lyn and Sheila provided an abundance of communication prior to the retreat, alleviating and potential anxiety and really fostering an environment of joy. The lodge was beautiful and maintained its authenticity to the surrounding environment. I can’t say enough good things and cannot wait to go again!! Pura Vida 🌊☀️"
