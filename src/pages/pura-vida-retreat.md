## The Epic Experience

In Playa Grande, Costa Rica

- SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2026 - SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2026

Join us for an immersive experience in nature where we will vinyasa to the sounds of birds and monkeys, create new friendships and perspectives, and be healed and rejuvenated by sun, sand, and movement. It’s time to unplug, lean into community, and treat yourself to an unforgettable experience.

2026 will be our 5th Pura Vida Costa Rica Retreat and will feature a brand new location that will inspire connection with nature and grant you tranquility - Sol Sanctuary.

This is a women’s retreat. Our retreat creates a supportive environment where all participants can feel safe, respected, and empowered to be their authentic selves. As one participant from 2025 said, “I expand in sisterhood!” We are committed to fostering meaningful connections and shared experiences that honor the full spectrum of women's lives and identities.

## More Love From Past Retreaters

> Costa Rica with Krysta-Lyn and Sheila is officially my favorite week of the entire year. I love escaping the winter months in New England to move my body, soak up the sun, swim in the ocean and connect with so many incredible women. The connections I make on this trip year after year are life changing and I walk away with lifelong friendships. I always learn something new about myself and fly home with fresh perspectives and rituals to bring with me throughout the rest of my year. Can't wait to book my 3rd year in a row in 2026!

> This retreat was nothing short of life-changing! Surrounded by lush nature and the vibrant energy of pura vida, I found deep healing, connection, and renewal. Each day was a beautiful blend of soul-nourishing yoga, meaningful conversations, and awesome adventures that awakened my spirit!

> I came into this experience with no expectations but truly feel that the woman I arrived as was so different than the woman I left as. I felt so supported and empowered by amazing women who came from all backgrounds and were all on different paths. I loved the balance of activities and free time, but also loved that there was no pressure to participate in everything. Sheila and Krysta-Lyn created such a safe and supportive space for us all to grow together. I can’t wait for next year!!

> Book immediately, do not hesitate! This is the trip you know you need for yourself to FINALLY get that time to breathe, think, reflect & take care. Sheila & Krysta-Lyn do all the thinking for us. Truly a rich experience and warm community of women who show up for one another!

> "This retreat was incredible. I got more than I could have possibly imagined from it - physically, mentally, spiritually. Just go it's the best way to pause, reset & focus."

> I loved every minute of the Pure Vida Retreat! This was my first experience taking an adventure like this, and any anxiety I felt washed away the minute I joined the community. I had a wonderful experience, made new friends, and challenged myself physically and spiritually. I can't wait until next year!

> I came with curiosity & and the intention to take time for myself. I left with a full heart, memories for a lifetime and peace inside. This warm feeling will stay forever thinking back. Sheila & Krista-Lynn are such beautiful humans and made you feel like family!

> I had the pleasure of attending Sheila & Krysta-Lyn’s 2025 Pura Vida yoga retreat in Costa Rica, and it was a fabulous experience! From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and embraced by a community of incredible women, each on her own unique journey. The retreat offered a blend of yoga, meditation, and local activities, which helped me reconnect with myself and cultivate relationships with other attendees. Sheila & Krysta-Lyn were the consummate retreat leaders! They took care of every detail. From transportation and meals to beach time and excursions, the retreat was well planned without feeling overly scheduled. The meals were a true highlight! Fresh, delicious, and locally sourced, each dish was a delightful experience for the senses. Sharing meals with fellow attendees created a sense of camaraderie. Overall, the retreat was a perfect combination of relaxation, rejuvenation, and personal growth. I left feeling inspired and supported thanks to the new friendships forged. I highly recommend this retreat to any woman looking to deepen her yoga practice and embrace her inner strength while spending time in a tropical paradise.

> I knew this would be a reflective and rejuvenating experience, however, the relationships and bonds that were made were beyond my expectations. Gathering with a diverse yet like-minded group of women was exactly what my soul needed.

> The Pura Vida retreat was such a breath of warm, fresh air in the midst of the winter! The organization and preparation of Sheila and Krysta-Lyn’s was evident with daily sessions and downtime smoothly planned out. Also, their passion for a yogic life and to lead women in a transformative week away from the chaos of normal day life.
