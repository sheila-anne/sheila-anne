## Autumn Alchemy Home

Welcome home to this gorgeous 6-bedroom mountain sanctuary. Enjoy the modern comforts inside with the thoughtfully-designed layout and amenities, while being only steps away from connecting with nature on the Sunday River trails.

Sip coffee while watching the sun rise over the mountains, decompress from the day in the hot tub, journal your heart out in the light-soaked living room, this place is ours to exhale into and fully enjoy.

One key aspect of this retreat is designated free time. We are all overscheduled, so this is your opportunity to actually release the grip of the grind and listen to the subtle cues of your body and creativity. We encourage you to bring puzzles, crafts, or just take time for naps. Healing happens not just in the big moments, but in the small choices in between.

## More words from past retreaters

> “The weekend was full of tears, laughter, and community, and I could not recommend it more. I came into the weekend feeling heavy with grief from a previous breakup and stressed from work and graduate school. I left the weekend feeling LIGHT as the heaviness had been lifted and FULL of the support and love from all the women on the retreat.”

> “The most powerful, healing, encouraging, and inspiring retreat or workshop I've ever been a part of.”

> “It was everything I didn't know I needed. Sheila created such a safe and welcoming environment that allowed true vulnerability and authenticity. It was equally relaxing, fun, and peaceful”

## FAQs

### Do I need to be good at yoga?

Not at all! Our retreat welcomes participants of all experience levels, from complete beginners to advanced practitioners. Our instructors provide modifications for every pose to accommodate different abilities and comfort levels. The focus is on your personal journey and connecting with your body, not achieving perfect poses. Many guests try yoga for the very first time at our retreat and leave with a newfound appreciation for the practice.

### I work a 9-5, do I need to take off Thursday and Friday?

For those with flexibilty and vacation time, we recommend taking off the latter half of Thursday (or the whole day if you'd like or are flying in!). That said, we want this retreat to be as accessible as possible, and you are welcome to travel up Friday morning for the retreat as well.

### I get anxious in groups, is this for me?

We keep our retreat intentionally intimate (~8-12 women) to foster a supportive, judgment-free environment. You're welcome to participate at your own comfort level - whether that means sharing your unique insight or listening and taking personal time when needed. Past participants who experience social anxiety have found our retreat to be a gentle way to connect with others at their own pace. This retreat in particular builds in free time to recharge on your own if you find value in that!

### Will there be Wi-Fi or cell service at the retreat?

While you will have access to Wi-Fi/cell service, we encourage disconnecting a bit during this wellness retreat, so you can fully be present with yourself and your community.. We recommend informing important contacts about your retreat plans before you go and embracing this opportunity to disconnect!
