> "Sheila's lunch and learn on work + life balance was amazing! I loved how relatable she was. It made me feel like even though we all have different things we were balancing I could trust her guidance. The slide deck was super helpful. I loved how easy her prompts and suggestions were. I felt like I left with concrete ways to start balancing my life better right away. Her talk has definitely changed how I view balance, and I use many of her tips every day. Loved this impactful and transformational talk!!" - Workshop participant
