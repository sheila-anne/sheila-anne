## About Reiki

Reiki is a Japanese healing technique that channels universal life force energy to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Through gentle touch or hands hovering over the body, Reiki helps to remove energy blockages, restore harmony, and enhance the body's natural healing abilities.

## Why Choose Reiki with Sheila

Sheila is committed to helping individuals and groups become more resourced, resilient, and effective in their lives and careers. As a Reiki practitioner, 200hr yoga instructor, ICF Professional Certified Coach, Trauma-Informed Certified Coach, and Corporate Wellness Seminar Provider, Sheila offers a holistic approach to healing and empowerment.

## What to Expect

During your Reiki session with Sheila, you can expect:

1.  **Personalized Care**: Sheila takes the time to understand your unique needs and concerns, tailoring each session to address your specific goals and intentions.
2.  **Deep Relaxation**: As you lay comfortably on a massage table, Sheila gently places her hands on or above your body (depending on your preference), allowing the healing energy of Reiki to flow effortlessly through you. You'll enter a state of deep relaxation and promote healing for your body, mind, and soul.
3.  **Energetic Balance**: Through the gentle touch of Reiki, Sheila works to harmonize your energy centers (chakras), creating balance and lightness throughout your entire being.
4.  **Emotional Release**: Reiki often facilitates emotional release, allowing you to let go of stored emotions and find greater clarity, peace, and inner strength. Everything is normal here: crying, laughing, smiling.
