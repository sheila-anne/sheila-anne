## About Reiki

Reiki is a Japanese healing technique that channels universal life force energy to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Through gentle touch or hands hovering over the body, Reiki helps to remove energy blockages, restore harmony, and enhance the body's natural healing abilities.

## Why Choose Reiki with Sheila

Sheila is committed to helping individuals and groups become more resourced, resilient, and effective in their lives and careers. As a Reiki practitioner, 200hr yoga instructor, ICF Professional Certified Coach, Trauma-Informed Certified Coach, and Corporate Wellness Seminar Provider, Sheila offers a holistic approach to healing and empowerment.

## What to Expect

During your Reiki session with Sheila, you can expect:

1.  **Personalized Care**: Sheila takes the time to understand your unique needs and concerns, tailoring each session to address your specific goals and intentions.
2.  **Deep Relaxation**: As you lay comfortably on a massage table, Sheila gently places her hands on or above your body (depending on your preference), allowing the healing energy of Reiki to flow effortlessly through you. You'll enter a state of deep relaxation and promote healing for your body, mind, and soul.
3.  **Energetic Balance**: Through the gentle touch of Reiki, Sheila works to harmonize your energy centers (chakras), creating balance and lightness throughout your entire being.
4.  **Emotional Release**: Reiki often facilitates emotional release, allowing you to let go of stored emotions and find greater clarity, peace, and inner strength. Everything is normal here: crying, laughing, smiling.

## Reviews

> Sheila provided the most special reiki experience for a friend and I. She customized the session for our wants/needs and it was more than we could ask for! We pulled cards, did a letting go exercise, and ended with a joint reiki. Sheila does an amazing job making you feel comfortable and explaining the process. Highly recommend working with her and experiencing the magic for yourself!

> Sheila is amazing! She did the most incredible Reiki session with me the weekend of my wedding. I was recovering from a concussion and knew I wanted to be extra grounded and present to enjoy the weekend with the people I love — and that doing so would be a challenge with a still sometimes foggy brain! She guided me so expertly and compassionately through setting an intention and the whole process felt like magic. It was my first experience with Reiki and Sheila was the perfect guide! On top of that, I didn’t have any concussion symptoms for the rest of the day. I still think this session was a big part of why I felt so good for my wedding! A true gift. Sheila is simply the best!

> My experience receiving reiki from Sheila was my best to date. She was loving, welcoming, and made space for any feelings that I came in with or that came up in the session. She was insightful with her findings and gave me all the information I needed to interpret my experience. She followed up with aftercare tips and checked in regarding any emotions that may have surfaced after our time together. I would recommend her to anyone with any level of experience.

> Before my wedding, I had the ultimate pleasure of experiencing a Reiki session with Sheila. It was a perfect self-care moment that centered me before the big day. Sheila’s healing touch and intention created a sense of calm and balance. Throughout my wedding, that oasis of calm stayed with me amidst the flurry of activity—it made all the difference.
