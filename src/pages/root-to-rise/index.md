    text: Working with Sheila has been nothing short of amazing! The
      breakthroughs I have had in the past few months have been life
      changing. She has an amazing talent for looking at the big picture and
      is one of the few people I‚Äôve ever met who is able to follow my
      scattermindedness, reflect on the important information and guide me
      back with powerful questioning. That, teamed with her ability to take
      you out of your mind and into your body to feel through the question
      is always an extraordinarily powerful experience.

      Not only has every session been absolutely amazing but Sheila helped
      me unearth the confidence I needed to take the biggest leap of my
      life. She allowed me to root back into my authentic self and lead with
      my heart. Without the work I have done with her the past few months I
      would still be stuck in a loop of fear, self doubt and would not be
      chasing my dreams. I am beyond grateful for the work I have done and
      the growth I‚Äôve experienced in the short time I have worked with her.

    text: I connected with Sheila at the beginning of my career pivot. I had been consulting for the past two years and was ready to make a change, but I wasn't sure how to move forward. Sheila guided me through a four-week meditation on what my next move might look like, including identifying core values and exploring how I could move forward deliberately and with confidence. I left our work together with a clearer picture of the kind of organization I'd like to contribute to, work-wise, and a more grounded sense of self and purpose.

# Root To Rise

![Root To Rise With Sheila Anne](/img/sheila-anne-root-to-rise.jpg)

## Get Grounded, Find Balance, Live Aligned

### Are you seeking a career change? Ready to feel less stuck in your job or routine? Looking to come home to yourself and your unique purpose?

### Welcome, you‚Äôre in just the right place.

<div style="background-color: #ecf4f3; padding: 1rem 2rem; border-radius: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

#### Is This You?

Are you a driven, free-spirit that has an endless list of things to do, places to see, and goals to achieve? Do you question your purpose and connection to your work? Do you crave a life and career that you love? Cultivating a life that is fulfilling and balanced does not come naturally in a world with so many things to do and ways to fill time!

Let me take a guess -- You‚Äôve probably tried various routines, self-help books, and have attended conferences and networking events. Perhaps you‚Äôve gotten involved in a fitness community or started a book club. Maybe you‚Äôve considered changing career paths or taking a leap of faith but something has held you back. Despite these attempts, something feels incomplete. You think to yourself _there must be something more_ ...

Why? Because for you it‚Äôs easy to make lists, check off action items, and let your busy brain lead the way. That‚Äôs your jam! When it comes to slowing down and doing the inner work, you‚Äôd rather be productive and perfect each piece of yourself.

Through your journey thus far, there‚Äôs been a little something missing -- that something that will help you pause, deeply connect, and set intentional goals toward your dream future. That‚Äôs where I come in.

I created the Root to Rise program because I know that free spirits like you are ready for _sustainable_ change, which can only come with dedicated time and effort.

## Root to Rise will enable you to:

- **Explore** all that makes you, you -- Through journaling, visualizations, and assessments you‚Äôll gain deep self awareness and purpose.
- **Discover** your core values and make all future decisions from a place of intention -- Let‚Äôs take the guessing out of decision making & create easy-flowing success.
- **Simplify** your life & infuse joy -- We‚Äôll talk about mindful rituals, minimalism, prioritization, and celebrating things that matter. Simplicity is a core principle of my coaching because I believe your life can be simple and full!
- **Cultivate** a mind-body connection that will help you prioritize your well being and make lasting change. Set aside your expectations for needing how-to guides and expensive wellness trends, we‚Äôre taking things a little deeper here! Here you‚Äôll face your inner monologue and self-sabotaging stories. We‚Äôll talk about how to develop a fresh mindset that is more aligned with the confidence and fulfillment you hope to create.
- **Create** an inspiring future -- Once you‚Äôve built the foundation, developed clarity around your future, and connected to your whole self -- your potential is limitless. You establish goals and action steps to get you there and have me as your accountability partner & cheerleader as you root and rise.

## Here‚Äôs what you can expect:

Once you‚Äôre officially enrolled in the programüçæ, I‚Äôll send you a discovery form, so you can start deepening your self awareness, and I can start learning alllll the good things that make you, you! Moreover, this form will help us create a baseline, where we will begin to root down and rise up throughout the three months. We will meet three times per month, for a total of nine sessions. In each session we will work together to break down challenges, explore opportunities, and come up with an action plan to get you your desired results. Think of each session as your safe space to breathe, tap in, and bloom.

## Why work with me?

Not only am I a Certified Professional Coach, I am also a recovering overachiever and life-long free spirit. I struggled for years feeling overwhelmed by everything I wanted to accomplish, learn, and experience. I wanted to do it all, while appearing totally in control and grounded. This led me toward perfectionist tendencies, an obsession with wellness, and emotional numbing. It wasn‚Äôt until my mom passed that I really set myself free. Inspired by her radiant energy, I started digging deeper into discovering who ‚ÄúSheila‚Äù really was, what she truly wanted, and what I needed to do to make it happen. The secret - very little of it was external. It wasn‚Äôt a promotion, validation, or a new fitness routine. I left my life in Boston, traveled for 5 months with my partner, and came home to myself in a way I never imagined possible. Now I‚Äôve created a path to help other free-spirited achievers to explore, discover, and transform into the most alive version of themselves üíô. I blend my yoga background and killer focus to bring you into a space that you can feel grounded, safe, and totally resourced to carve your next path.

## Here‚Äôs how much I believe in us ‚Ä¶

I offer a money-back guarantee! If after our initial 90 minute session you are totally not vibing with the energy, I‚Äôll cancel your spot and return your investment.

## Let‚Äôs go!
