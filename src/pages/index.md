    text: Working with Sheila is a gift that brings clarity, peace, and confidence. I was teetering on a big career decision and decided to work with Sheila to chart the path forward. She helped me to understand what was truly important to me, and to design my ideal life as an entrepreneur, mom, wife, friend, and lifelong learner! One of the amazing results of working with Sheila is a business I've been waiting my entire career to launch - collective-coaching.com. So grateful for her services. She changed my life

      Working with Sheila has been nothing short of amazing! When we first started working together I was in a relationship that was far from healthy. My sanity and physical well-being were at risk. With her help, I was able to too root back into my authentic self, gain confidence and lead with my heart to leave that situation.

      That leap led me to move into a trailer, build my business, put my health above all else, and live a life that allows me to truly express myself. I do not remember the last time I was able to live in such a state of ease like I am right now.

      Without the work I have done with her the past few months I would still be stuck in a loop of fear, self doubt and crippling anxiety.

> "We formed small, actionable goals week by week, pivoting with my priorities, and I achieved all of them. Sheila is the kind of coach that feels like a deep exhale and a sigh of relief."

> “Over the span of 3 months I went from having panic attacks at work to having the strength to walk away and sign up for classes towards a masters degree.”
