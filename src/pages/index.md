    text: Working with Sheila has been nothing short of amazing! The
      breakthroughs I have had in the past few months have been life
      changing. She has an amazing talent for looking at the big picture and
      is one of the few people I’ve ever met who is able to follow my
      scattermindedness, reflect on the important information and guide me
      back with powerful questioning. That, teamed with her ability to take
      you out of your mind and into your body to feel through the question
      is always an extraordinarily powerful experience.

      Not only has every session been absolutely amazing but Sheila helped
      me unearth the confidence I needed to take the biggest leap of my
      life. She allowed me to root back into my authentic self and lead with
      my heart. Without the work I have done with her the past few months I
      would still be stuck in a loop of fear, self doubt and would not be
      chasing my dreams. I am beyond grateful for the work I have done and
      the growth I’ve experienced in the short time I have worked with her.

    text: I connected with Sheila at the beginning of my career pivot. I had been consulting for the past two years and was ready to make a change, but I wasn't sure how to move forward. Sheila guided me through a four-week meditation on what my next move might look like, including identifying core values and exploring how I could move forward deliberately and with confidence. I left our work together with a clearer picture of the kind of organization I'd like to contribute to, work-wise, and a more grounded sense of self and purpose.
