faq:
  - question: How do I know if coaching is right for me?
    answer: >
      Life coaching is an effective way to progress your life into one that feels aligned, empowered, and fulfilling.  Coaching is designed to continually give power back to the client, to cultivate more growth and self-understanding. If you find yourself feeling like you might not be doing what you really want to do, in your career, physical space, relationships, activities, etc., life coaching can help you gain clarity in your future and take actions toward transformation. Different coaches will have different approaches and niches, so clients have options of the type of coach they want to work with. I specifically focus on health & wellness, life purpose, career coaching, and managing grief & change. To learn more about if we are a good fit, sign up for a complimentary 30 minute call.
  - question: How is coaching different from therapy?
    answer: >
      Therapy can be an amazing tool for working through past experiences, and with the right therapist you can create a beautiful space for healing and personal growth. On the other hand, life coaching is future-focused and progress oriented.  Sessions will focus on where you are and where you want to go. Though we may touch on the past to gain more perspective and context, we will always be bringing it back to the present and the future. I will also support you with accountability tools and homework, because I know that many of the successes and the “a-ha”s actually occur outside of our time together.
  - question: Where are the coaching sessions held?
    answer: >
      Most clients and I meet via video conferencing.  I use a platform that allows us to meet in a private room and communicate in real time with clear video and sound.  I send a meeting link prior to our scheduled appointment.  Alternatively, we can meet via phone calls.
  - question: What can I expect to get out of coaching with Sheila Anne?
    answer: >
      Since life coaching is a client-driven experience, you are in the driver's seat. Put lots of effort into our sessions & into your life in between, and you will be rewarded exponentially! Each time we meet, you will come with something specific that you want to focus on (yes, it’s ok if the conversation organically takes a new direction if that’s what you want!) and it’s my job to support you with tools and additional perspectives. At the end we’ll decide together what actions you will be accountable for before our next session, so you are always moving forward toward your goals. Each time we meet we will celebrate any accomplishments, and you also may always share personal frustrations and questions.
