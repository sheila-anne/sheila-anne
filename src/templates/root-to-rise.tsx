      <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Whole Person Certified Coach who has helped dozens of women to level up their lives and find ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs
        next.‚Äù I blend my professional coach training, yoga background, killer focus to bring you into a space that you
        can feel grounded, safe, and totally resourced to step into the career, relationships, and life you deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn‚Äôt just a process I facilitate: this is personal, as I struggled for years feeling that life wasn‚Äôt
        exactly how I wanted it to be, but when it came to making a shift, I didn‚Äôt know where to start.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn‚Äôt until my mom passed that I set myself free. Inspired by her radiant energy, I started digging deeper
        into discovering who ‚ÄúSheila‚Äù really was, what she truly wanted, and what I needed to do to make it happen. My
        world exploded with opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mission is to ensure that you don‚Äôt waste one more day wondering what‚Äôs next, how you‚Äôll get there, or if you
        deserve it. Your time is now üöÄ!
      </p>
      <h2>Here‚Äôs how much I believe in us ‚Ä¶</h2>
      <p>
        I offer a <b>money-back guarantee!</b> If after our initial Self-Discovery Deep Dive, if you are totally{" "}
        <i>not</i> vibing with the energy, I‚Äôll cancel your spot and return your investment.
