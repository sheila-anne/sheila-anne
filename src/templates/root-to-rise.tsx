          Are you a high-achiever that consistently hustles, builds connections, and accomplishes goals but you still
          feel like something is missing? Do you daydream about taking bigger risks, racing toward new heights, while
          feeling totally in flow and balanced?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Are you wondering: <i>‚ÄúIs that even possible for me?‚Äù</i>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Welcome. You're in just the right place.</b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Through your journey thus far, there‚Äôs been a little something missing ‚Äî that something that will help you
          pause, deeply connect, and set intentional goals toward your next adventure. That‚Äôs where I come in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Why? Because for you it‚Äôs easy to make lists, check off action items, and let your busy brain lead the way.
          That‚Äôs your jam! When it comes to slowing down and doing the inner work, you‚Äôd rather be productive and
          perfect each piece of yourself.

        previous ‚Äî you will root down to establish a solid base of values & intentions, and rise up to make big waves in
        your career, relationships, and lifestyle.

      <p>
        I am a Whole Person Certified & ICF Associate Certified Coach who has helped dozens of ambitious women to create

        relationships, and life you deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn‚Äôt just a process I facilitate: this is personal, as I struggled for years feeling that life wasn‚Äôt
        exactly how I wanted it to be, but when it came to making a shift, I didn‚Äôt know where to start.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn‚Äôt until my mom passed that I set myself free. Inspired by her radiant energy, I started digging deeper
        into discovering who ‚ÄúSheila‚Äù really was, what she truly wanted, and what I needed to do to make it happen. My
        world exploded with opportunity.
      </p>
