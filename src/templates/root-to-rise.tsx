        Are you seeking a career change? Ready to feel less stuck in your job or
        routine? Looking to come home to yourself and your unique purpose?

        <h4>Is This You?</h4>
        <p>
          Are you a driven, free-spirit that has an endless list of things to
          do, places to see, and goals to achieve? Do you question your purpose
          and connection to your work? Do you crave a life and career that you
          love? Cultivating a life that is fulfilling and balanced does not come
          naturally in a world with so many things to do and ways to fill time!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Let me take a guess ‚Äî You‚Äôve probably tried various routines,
          self-help books, and have attended conferences and networking events.
          Perhaps you‚Äôve gotten involved in a fitness community or started a
          book club. Maybe you‚Äôve considered changing career paths or taking a
          leap of faith but something has held you back. Despite these attempts,
          something feels incomplete. You think to yourself{" "}
          <i>there must be something more</i> ...
        </p>
        <br />
        Why? Because for you it‚Äôs easy to make lists, check off action items,
        and let your busy brain lead the way. That‚Äôs your jam! When it comes to
        slowing down and doing the inner work, you‚Äôd rather be productive and
        perfect each piece of yourself. Through your journey thus far, there‚Äôs
        been a little something missing ‚Äî that something that will help you
        pause, deeply connect, and set intentional goals toward your dream
        future. That‚Äôs where I come in.

        <p>
          Once you‚Äôre officially enrolled in the programüçæ, I‚Äôll send you a
          discovery form, so you can start deepening your self awareness, and I
          can start learning alllll the good things that make you, you!
          Moreover, this form will help us create a baseline, where we will
          begin to root down and rise up throughout the three months. We will
          meet three times per month, for a total of nine sessions. In each
          session we will work together to break down challenges, explore
          opportunities, and come up with an action plan to get you your desired
          results. Think of each session as your safe space to breathe, tap in,
          and bloom.

      <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
      <p>
        Not only am I a Certified Professional Coach, I am also a recovering
        overachiever and life-long free spirit. I struggled for years feeling
        overwhelmed by everything I wanted to accomplish, learn, and experience.
        I wanted to do it all, while appearing totally in control and grounded.
        This led me toward perfectionist tendencies, an obsession with wellness,
        and emotional numbing. It wasn‚Äôt until my mom passed that I really set
        myself free. Inspired by her radiant energy, I started digging deeper
        into discovering who ‚ÄúSheila‚Äù really was, what she truly wanted, and
        what I needed to do to make it happen. The secret - very little of it
        was external. It wasn‚Äôt a promotion, validation, or a new fitness
        routine. I left my life in Boston, traveled for 5 months with my
        partner, and came home to myself in a way I never imagined possible. Now
        I‚Äôve created a path to help other free-spirited achievers to explore,
        discover, and transform into the most alive version of themselves üíô. I
        blend my yoga background and killer focus to bring you into a space that
        you can feel grounded, safe, and totally resourced to carve your next
        path.
      </p>
      <h2>Here‚Äôs how much I believe in us ‚Ä¶</h2>
      <p>
        I offer a money-back guarantee! If after our initial 90 minute session
        you are totally not vibing with the energy, I‚Äôll cancel your spot and
        return your investment.
