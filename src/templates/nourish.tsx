          "Nourish transformed my life, in the way I speak, react and manifest. Coming into this program I was always
          rushing myself to be the best and my internal voice was chaotic. I am now more still and savoring moments. I'm
          creating clear boundaries, saying yes to only things that light me up, I'm decisive, more in control and
          because I am now clear the world around me is clearer too. This program helped me develop a true sense of self

              Through the tragic loss of my mother, pivoting my career (again and again), leaving the corporate world,
              falling in love, and uprooting my life countless times, I've learned that anything is possible when you
              are connected to the pillars of body, mind, and soul. I created Nourish to support women like you to
              integrate tools for life so that, no matter what season you're in, you can always come home to yourself
              and cultivate a deeply meaningful life. Why a group coaching experience? Growing individually, within
              community, is one of the best things we can do for ourselves. Imagine the positive impact of being seen,
              heard, and celebrated by other ambitious women every step of your journey. I am a professionally certified
              and trauma-informed coach with over 500 hours of coaching women to step into their desired lives. I am
              also a yoga instructor and have expertise in embodiment, nervous system regulation, and mindfulness. This
              program is a work of my soul and I am beyond grateful to be able to share it with you.

        <h2>What people are saying about the Nourish experience</h2>
        <StyledQuote>
          ‚ÄúNourish is a life changing program that provides a safe space for a supportive community filled with mutual
          growth, experiential learning and emotional connection. While the group functions well as a whole, the
          individual progress and growth is undeniable. You are guided in one collective direction while having a slew
          of personalized options for building your journey for what suits you at that moment. I sought out Nourish as
          an intimate way to unite the compartmentalized parts of my being and I am leaving it with a new community, the
          tools to infinitely build on my beautiful base self and a sense of union with myself and my once divided
          life.‚Äù - Emma

          ‚ÄúThis program was unlike anything I've ever done before. When I first started my stress and anxiety were at an
          all time high. Not only was the program mentally restorative for me it was incredibly transformative. I
          cultivated some long lasting friendships, dug deeper into myself than I ever have, and took chances I wouldn't
          have been strong enough to without the support of Sheila and the women in the Nourish community.‚Äù - Jenna

          ‚ÄúNourish helped me claim back my power to make aligned decisions for a more fulfilling life. Coming into the
          program, I was struggling with anxiety and felt like an empty vessel. I now feel like I have new tools to
          magnetize what is truly meant for me--guilt free.‚Äù - Elaina

          ‚ÄúI joined Nourish because I wanted to make lasting changes within myself. When I started my Nourish journey, I
          was living my life at an unsustainable pace marked by anxious thoughts, indecision, and shallow breaths.
          Working through this program with Sheila and the amazing first cohort of Nourish women helped me to transform
          in ways I could not have imagined four months ago. A few examples of the impact of Nourish: Slower internal
          pace; Increased confidence in my ability to make aligned choices; Deeper, conscious breath. I am so grateful
          for Sheila and the support of all my fellow Nourish women.‚Äù - Carolyn
