          ‚ÄúNourish is a life changing program that provides a safe space for a supportive community filled with mutual
          growth, experiential learning and emotional connection. While the group functions well as a whole, the
          individual progress and growth is undeniable. You are guided in one collective direction while having a slew
          of personalized options for building your journey for what suits you at that moment. I sought out Nourish as
          an intimate way to unite the compartmentalized parts of my being and I am leaving it with a new community, the
          tools to infinitely build on my beautiful base self and a sense of union with myself and my once divided
          life.‚Äù - Emma

          ‚ÄúThis program was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever done before. When I first started my stress and anxiety were at an
          all time high. Not only was the program mentally restorative for me it was incredibly transformative. I
          cultivated some long lasting friendships, dug deeper into myself than I ever have, and took chances I wouldn‚Äôt
          have been strong enough to without the support of Sheila and the women in the Nourish community.‚Äù - Jenna

          ‚ÄúI joined Nourish because I wanted to make lasting changes within myself. When I started my Nourish journey, I
          was living my life at an unsustainable pace marked by anxious thoughts, indecision, and shallow breaths.
          Working through this program with Sheila and the amazing first cohort of Nourish women helped me to transform
          in ways I could not have imagined four months ago. A few examples of the impact of Nourish: Slower internal
          pace; Increased confidence in my ability to make aligned choices; Deeper, conscious breath. I am so grateful
