              Through the tragic loss of my mother, pivoting my career (again and again), leaving the corporate world,
              falling in love, and uprooting my life countless times, I've learned that anything is possible when you
              are connected to the pillars of body, mind, and soul. I created Nourish to support women like you to
              integrate tools for life so that, no matter what season you're in, you can always come home to yourself
              and cultivate a deeply meaningful life. Why a group coaching experience? Growing individually, within
              community, is one of the best things we can do for ourselves. Imagine the positive impact of being seen,
              heard, and celebrated by other ambitious women every step of your journey. I am a professionally certified
              and trauma-informed coach with over 500 hours of coaching women to step into their desired lives. I am
              also a yoga instructor and have expertise in embodiment, nervous system regulation, and mindfulness. This
              program is a work of my soul and I am beyond grateful to be able to share it with you.

          ‚ÄúNourish is a life changing program that provides a safe space for a supportive community filled with mutual
          growth, experiential learning and emotional connection. While the group functions well as a whole, the
          individual progress and growth is undeniable. You are guided in one collective direction while having a slew
          of personalized options for building your journey for what suits you at that moment. I sought out Nourish as
          an intimate way to unite the compartmentalized parts of my being and I am leaving it with a new community, the
          tools to infinitely build on my beautiful base self and a sense of union with myself and my once divided

          cultivated some long lasting friendships, dug deeper into myself than I ever have, and took chances I wouldn‚Äôt

          was living my life at an unsustainable pace marked by anxious thoughts, indecision, and shallow breaths.
          Working through this program with Sheila and the amazing first cohort of Nourish women helped me to transform
          in ways I could not have imagined four months ago. A few examples of the impact of Nourish: Slower internal
